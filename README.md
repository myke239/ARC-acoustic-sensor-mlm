These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Currently only tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8.5 but will most likely work on windows and other versions of python.

### Prerequisites
<br/>

The main Python and package version requirements are:
```
Python=3.8.5 and virtual environment
Tensorflow=2.2.0
Keras=2.3.1
```
<br/><br/>
Installing Python3 and dependencies.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
sudo apt install wget
```
If you have an nVidia graphics card with CUDA support you can install the CUDA toolkit
so tensorflow can run directly on your GPU.
```
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```


<br/><br/>
Check which version of Python you have installed:
```
python3
Python 3.8.5 (default, Jul 28 2020, 12:59:40) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
If there was already a different version of Python3 installed, it's not a problem,
you'll just have to run ```python3.8``` instead of ```python3``` for commands below.
<br/><br/><br/>

### Download Code

Clone the repository into your home folder or wherever you want the project to be.
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/myke239/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm.git
```
<br/><br/>
Change directories into folder you just downloaded.
```
cd ~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm
```
<br/><br/>
Create python virtual environment and activate it.
```
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm$: python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm$: source ./venv/bin/activate  # sh, bash, or zsh
```
<br/><br/>
To leave the python virtual environment.
```
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmdeactivate
```
<br/><br/>
In the virtual environment install Python package requirements for the project.
```
cd ~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm$: source ./venv/bin/activate
(venv) ~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmpip install --upgrade pip
(venv) ~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmpip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br/><br/>
Verify Tensorflow was installed correctly:
```
(venv) ~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmpython -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))"
```

As long as you don't have any Python module related errors you should be fine, the last part of the output should be:
```
tf.Tensor(324.51093, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

There may be a number of messages from tensorflow about not being able to load dynamic libraries:
```

Please make sure the missing libraries mentioned above are installed properly if you would like to use GPU. Follow the guide at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu for how to download and setup the required libraries for your platform.
```
These warnings can be ignored for now. It means that tensorflow will run on your CPU instead of GPU. Tensorflow related tasks will take longer but these warnings won't stop the program from running.
<br/><br/><br/>
### Download Example Data
In the project folder download example acoustic data. It doesn't matter if you do this from within the virtual environment or not.
```
cd ~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmgit clone https://github.com/myke239/ARC-CEL-acoustic-sensor-data.git
```
Rename the repo folder to ```data``` for ease later.
```
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmmv ARC-CEL-acoustic-sensor-data data
```
<br/><br/>
NOTE: The example data set is quite large (over 5GB), to download only one folder or .zip file use:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myke239/ARC-CEL-acoustic-sensor-data/main/*folder-or-file-name*
If you decide to download individual files first, then create a data folder in the project first to store the files.
```
cd ~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmmkdir data
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlmcd data
~/ARC-acoustic-sensor-mlm/datawget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myke239/ARC-CEL-acoustic-sensor-data/main/wireshark/   TODO: complete
